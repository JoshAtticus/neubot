            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing or using neubot, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy.
                    If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the service.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="legal-section">
                <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
                <p>neubot is a simple semantic parsing based chatbot that uses natural language processing techniques
                    rather than large language models (LLMs) or AI. It provides tools for time, date, search, weather
                    and optional home automation controls through a clean user interface.</p>
                <p>Unlike AI assistants, neubot doesn't learn from your interactions, doesn't keep logs of your queries
                    for tracking or profiling purposes, and processes information using traditional programming methods.
                </p>
                <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the service at any time without notice.</p>
            </div>

                <h2>4. Rate Limits and Usage</h2>
                <p>The service includes rate limits that vary based on account status. Free users have lower limits
                    compared to signed-in users. We reserve the right to adjust these limits at our discretion.
                    Attempting to circumvent rate limits is prohibited and may result in account termination.</p>
